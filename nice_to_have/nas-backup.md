# üì¶ Nice-to-Have: NAS Backup with Time Machine (macOS)

This section describes how to configure **Time Machine** on your MacBook to use Renuo's NAS (Network Attached Storage) over SMB as the backup destination. This gives you automatic versioned backups of your system and data.

## Setup Steps

1. **Retrieve credentials from 1Password**

   - Open **1Password**.  
   - Find the entry **`[Renuo-NAS] Backup User`**.  
   - Copy the:  
     1. **Username**  
     2. **Password**  
     3. **Server Address**

   > Example placeholders:  
   > - Server Address: `smb://NAS_ADDRESS/laptop_backups`  
   > - Username: `backupuser`  
   > - Password: `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢`

   üëâ Tip: You can also **click the `smb://` link directly in 1Password** to open the connection prompt directly without following step 2 but ensure to use username and password combo provided in 1PW. If you do so, you can skip to step 3.

   - Click **Done**.
