# Basic Tools Setup

Now follows the part where it gets more technical. There's a convention at Renuo for the directory structure of projects. In every project you'll find the following files:

- For setting up the project: ``` bin/setup ```
- To run the tests: ``` bin/check ```
- to run and try the application: ``` bin/run ```

There are some requirements which need to be met first that this works. The following steps are going to prepare your system for that.

If you are experienced you can choose your own setup, but we recommend that you follow our setup instructions.
