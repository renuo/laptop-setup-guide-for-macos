# Basic Tools Setup

Now follows the part where it gets more technical. There's a convention at Renuo for the directory structure of projects. In every project you'll find the following files:

- For setting up the project: ``` bin/setup ```
- To run the tests: ``` bin/check ```
- to run and try the application: ``` bin/run ```

There are some requirements which need to be met first that this works. The following steps are going to prepare your system for that.

If you are experienced you can choose your own setup, but we recommend that you follow our setup instructions.

Please don’t skip parts of this guide and don’t start with the next part or command if you haven’t finished the previous one. In general, the commands are only guaranteed to **work in the order of the guide** and cannot be parallelized.
- **Read and understand the command line outputs:** The installer will tell you useful / necessary hints, which may require action. Additionally, this guide may be partly outdated soon, which makes it even more important to read the outputs of the installers.
- **Discuss changes:** Please extend or correct this guide if you think the information is missing, wrong or outdated. Discuss the changes you want to make here with at least one other person before you make them.
- **Ask for help:** If you have any questions, please ask for help. We are happy to help you.
