# Console Editor

## Vim

This is a highly configurable console editor which can be expected to be present on every Renuo system.

- ```brew install vim```


In the following sections we need to create and edit a lot of files. We will use Vim for this. If you are not familiar with Vim, you can use Visual Studio Code for example.

## Visual Studio Code (Recommended for Interns)

Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Once installed, open the command palette (⇧⌘P) and type `shell command` to find the Shell Command: "Install 'code' command in PATH command".

## How to

**Create a file**

```touch <filename>```

**Open a file**

```vim <filename>```
or
```code <filename>```

**Example**

```bash
touch .gitconfig


code .gitconfig
# or
vim .gitconfig
```
