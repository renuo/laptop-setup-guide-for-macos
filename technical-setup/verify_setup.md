# Congratulations ðŸ¥³

You are now ready to start working with the Renuo stack.

One last thing to do is to verify that everything is working.

## Verify the Setup

Now you should be able to clone any project from the Renuo GitHub and start up the website.

To verify this:

1. Clone a project. e.g.: [Gifcoins2](https://github.com/renuo/gifcoins2)
2. Use: ```bin/setup```
3. Use: ```bin/run```

Open the website in Google Chrome and check if everything is working.
