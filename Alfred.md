# Alfred

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is an app which can replace the Spotlight search. Next, we will install some more essential apps by installing [Caskroom Github](https://caskroom.github.io/.)

- ```brew cask install alfred```

Start alfred and configure it to automatically start after login. Restart the machine and use Alfred from now on **(option+space)** instead of Spotlight (command+space).

**Plugins:**
- [Alfred Fast Fuzzy Github Repos](https://github.com/renuo/alfred-fast-fuzzy-github-repos)
