# Software Updates & Programs

## Google Chrome

Although you are free to use your favorite Browser on a daily basis, we require Chrome to be installed on all our laptops:

1. Download Google Chrome installer: [Google chrome](https://google.com/chrome)(important: english version of chrome)
2. Open downloaded .dmg file to install (drag n’ drop).
3. Open Chrome
4. Login to Chrome with @renuo credentials
5. Click "link data" (If you already installed plugins with your account, they should be synchronized now.) and then "Ok got it"

## Verify AppleID

If you didn’t use the Renuo Apple ID to setup your MacBook go to [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/) and create a new Apple ID with the Renuo Email.

1. Go back to the iCloud configuration dialog and verify your email address by clicking "continue"
2. Enter the verification code you just got per email (you find your emails under [Gmail](https://gmail.com))

## System Updates

1. Open App Store, go to "Updates" and click "Update All" if available (Turn on Auto Updates if you're asked)
2. You may be asked to connect your AppleID to the app store (review). You can safely do it.
3. Go to “System Preferences” > “Software Update” and click on update all
4. Restart after updates have been installed/a restart button is visible (during the update you can already do the next steps **(until Chapter Xcode))**
5. Repeat from Step 2 and 3 until there are no more updates left

## Employees spreadsheet

Check if your employee data is entered in the personal data spreadsheet [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/renuo.ch/spreadsheets/d/1rJFJQCgpz6GajMlGf0anKwVl5AY6TrYjMnJ4W-_0MK4/edit?usp=sharing) and add it if necessary. This is the official employees list and should always be kept up-to-date.

Most likely the only thing is missing is the **Emergency Contact Person (+relation)**

## Inventory List

Please enter the laptop serial number into the [Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1Cc-KOhiQG0gZQlPlcHkyDlZJ1kDIOBK_QqePQasX9OQ/) edit spreadsheet and check if the correct laptop is assigned to you!)

See: Find the serial number of your Apple product: [Serial-Nr.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204308)

## Apple Developer

Go to: [Developer](https://developer.apple.com)

1. Click on "Account", login with your AppleID

## Github

## Better macOS Terminal

We recommend you to use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/iTerm2) - macOS Terminal Replacement but you can freely choose your desired terminal application.

## Tracky

**WIP: Nick Flückiger add tracky description here**
Tracky is an internal Redmine Plugin to manage our time entries. You can split your time on multiple tickets and start/stop by timer.

Go to: [Redmine](https://redmine.renuo.ch/timer_sessions)

To start your session for the setup just input your ticket number or subscription into the top input field and select the relevant ticket. Now start the timer by pressing start.

- Start tracker when you start working
- Stop tracker when you leave the office
- Keep small tracked times. New Timer for new Task (later Customer wants to know what you did)
- Track always with a ticket number and a meaningful description

## XCode

1. Open App Store
2. Search for Xcode, click Install (provide credentials if asked). This can take very long, so it would be a good moment for a round of pool.
3. Now you should see in the Mac menu below (Dock) the progress in the Launchpad icon
4. Restart Mac after everything has been installed
5. Check for remaining updates and install them
6. Repeat from Step 4 until there are no more updates left
7. Open Xcode and agree to license, then quit
