# Software Updates & Programs

## Google Chrome

Although you are free to use your favorite Browser on a daily basis, we require Chrome to be installed on all our laptops:

1. Download Google Chrome installer: [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) (important: english version of chrome)
2. Login to Chrome with @renuo.ch credentials
3. Click "link data" (If you already installed plugins with your account, they should be synchronized now.) and then "Ok got it"

## 1Password

We use 1Password to store all our passwords. Download the latest 1Password from the website and login with your @renuo.ch account.

From now on, you should use 1Password to store **all your passwords**.

## Create a Renuo AppleID

If you didn‚Äôt use the Renuo Apple ID to setup your MacBook go to [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/) and create a new Apple ID with the Renuo Email.
This Renuo AppleID is used to install Testflight apps and later to publish apps to the App Store.

**Verify your AppleID**

1. Go back icloud.com and verify your email address by clicking "continue"
2. Enter the verification code you just got per email (you find your emails under [Gmail](https://gmail.com))

## System Updates

1. Go to "Software Update" in the system preferences and install all available updates.
2. Enable automatic updates for all apps and the system
3. Restart after updates have been installed
4. Repeat step 1 through 3 until there are no more updates left

While the updates are installing, you can already do the next steps.

## Github

Github is our main host for source code repositories, versioned with Git.

1. **If you don't already have an account**, please go there and create one: [Github](https://github.com)
2. After having done so, ask someone to add you to the Renuo organization to access our private repositories.

## Slack

1. Download Slack from the App Store
2. Login with Google and your @renuo.ch account
3. You should be able to join the Renuo slack now

Now set your nickname to your fist name, all lowercase. E.g. Max Muster = max

## Google Chrome Extensions

1. **GitHub PR-Counter:** There's a Chrome plugin which shows how many pull requests you have. You can follow the instructions of the Plugin to set it up.
2. **1Password:** Ask someone to add you to the Renuo Account. Then follow the instructions in the mail.

Feel free to install any other extension that you like.

## Gravatar

Upload a picture of yourself and add your Renuo email addresses to your profile.
If you don't have a Gravatar account yet, then create one here: [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/)

## Gifcoins.io

Ask someone to give you your first Gifcoins ü•≥
Then you should automatically get added to the team.

## Redmine & Tracky

Check your email for the Redmine invitation. If you don't have one, ask someone to add you to the Renuo Account.

**Tracky** is an internal Redmine Plugin to manage our time entries. You can split your time on multiple tickets and start/stop by timer.
Go to [Redmine](https://redmine.renuo.ch/timer_sessions)

To start your session for the setup just input your ticket number or subscription into the top input field and select the relevant ticket. Now start the timer by pressing start.

- Start tracker when you start working
- Stop tracker when you leave the office
- Keep small tracked times. New Timer for new Task (later Customer wants to know what you did)
- Track always with a ticket number and a meaningful description

By the way, [Redmine Tracky is open source](https://github.com/renuo/redmine_tracky/). PRs are always welcome üòÅ.
