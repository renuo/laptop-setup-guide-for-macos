# Renuo Specific Information

The following documents are only relevant for Renuo employees.
If you are not a Renuo employee, you can skip this section.

## Employees spreadsheet

Check if your employee data is entered in the personal data spreadsheet [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/renuo.ch/spreadsheets/d/1rJFJQCgpz6GajMlGf0anKwVl5AY6TrYjMnJ4W-_0MK4/edit?usp=sharing) and add it if necessary. This is the official employees list and should always be kept up-to-date.

Most likely the only thing is missing is the **Emergency Contact Person (+relation)**

## Inventory List

Please enter the laptop serial number into the [Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1Cc-KOhiQG0gZQlPlcHkyDlZJ1kDIOBK_QqePQasX9OQ/) edit spreadsheet and check if the correct laptop is assigned to you!
