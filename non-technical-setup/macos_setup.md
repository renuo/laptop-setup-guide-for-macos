# macOS Setup

Now we're going to set up your freshly unboxed Macbook. Here in the list are some important settings to consider.

**Read them first:**

- **Apple ID:** Create a new Renuo Apple ID (Renuo email address) or use your own one.
- **Language:** Prefer English as main language
- **Wifi:** Use "Renuo Wifi"
- **Find my:** Enable Location Services
- **iCloud:** Set up iCloud Keychain
- **Turn on FileVault disk encryption, Allow iCloud account to unlock my disk**

All other things are optional and you can choose them by yourself

Start the machine and follow the macOS Setup.

## Further important settings: System Preferences

Open the system preferences and configure the following options. Some options need a password.
Each macOS version has a different system preferences. So some options may be missing or have a different name.

- **Security & Privacy**
  - **Password:** Require Password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins
  - **FileVault:** This encrypts your hard disk. Make sure it’s enabled. Store your recovery key in iCloud Keychain.
  - **Firewall:** Turn on firewall.

- **iCloud**
  - **Find my:** Turn on Find my Mac. This will allow you to find your Mac if it’s lost or stolen.
  - Disable everything else because we're going to synchronize everything with Google in the next step.

- **Internet Accounts**
  - **Add "Google":**
    - Login with @renuo.ch
    - Choose what you want
